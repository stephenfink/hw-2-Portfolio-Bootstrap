# Homework 2: Bootstap Portfolio

This is my portfolio layout using bootstrap, CSS, and Google fonts.

## Notes
    There is some empty divs that help with the spacing and placement of objects
    an example

    '''
    main class="contrainer">
    <section class="row">
      <div class="col-md-1"></div><!--This is the example-->
      <img src="cowboy xoomed in.JPG" alt="cowboy" style="width: 220px ;" class="col-md-3 cowboyB"></div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
    
    
    '''

    I did this to give it more side spacing and if I needed to add aside with information if need be.

## Important note
   The issue I came across is when submitting emails. My first goal was to have a text box like the example of a fully working box.
   In which a user can input their information and it will come as a email.

   I changed the box to include my phone number. I realized when changing screen size it works besides the contact page.
   This is because I wanted to have space to add more social media outlets in the future.

   My overall layout is using the functions of CSS in which I can change one number to suit the needs of all the html pages.

   I thank you for your time.
